# Curry base

Put the pan on the fire, and add some fat.

The fat could be:

- Olive oil
- Coconut oil
- Ghee
- Palm oil
- sunflower oil

I personally prefer olive oil.

When the fat is hot, add your oignons. When your oignons starts to become yellow, you can add something sweet to decrease the bitterness of the oignons. It could be sugar or honey.

And then, you can add your curry. I personally recommend fresh curry paste, but you can also use curry powder.

You can also add at this time some chili, depending on your taste.
